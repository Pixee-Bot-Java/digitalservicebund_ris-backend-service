  The query gets all rows where searchStr is anywhere in the label.
  The CASE statements are used to order the results into 3 priority classes:

  1. searchStr is start of label
  2. searchStr is start of a word within label: indicated by being after a space or a dash
  3. that leaves the else case: searchStr is anywhere in the string

  The order of the CASE statements is important. If the 3rd would be first, there would only be
  results of priority 3.
  Within a priority class, ordering is alphabetical.
